      <description>The problem My settings and configs had no way to sync between my desktop and laptop, e.g. all my custom keybinds would be on one computer but not the other.
The solution Using python 3 I wrote a script that can copy and install config files to and from a given directory (I used my nextcloud server). The source code is on my Github, but I would highly recommend that you&amp;rsquo;re careful and use a test directory if you want to modify the code - I acciedently deleted my config files more then once while testing.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2018 and taught my self python 3 and built my first Discord bot for my server. A couple months later, I rewrote the entire project using a fork on the discord.py library, discord rewrite - here&amp;rsquo;s the up to date repo. The project as a whole was a great intrudction to python, my favourite part of the whole project would have to be the hearthstone deckstring decoder.</description>
