      <description>Getting the machine up-to-date  sudo su
apt autoremove
apt update
apt upgrade
 Installing Apache - the webserver  apt install apache2
systemctl start apache2
systemctl enable apache2- start apache2 on startup
If you&amp;rsquo;ve configured the server right, you should be able to go to your machine&amp;rsquo;s IP (you can get this via hostname -I) in the webbrowser of your choice and see the &amp;ldquo;Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>The problem My settings and configs had no way to sync between my desktop and laptop, e.g. all my custom keybinds would be on one computer but not the other.
The solution Using python 3 I wrote a script that can copy and install config files to and from a given directory (I used my nextcloud server). The source code is on my Github, but I would highly recommend that you&amp;rsquo;re careful and use a test directory if you want to modify the code - I acciedently deleted my config files more then once while testing.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2018 and taught my self python 3 and built my first Discord bot for my server. A couple months later, I rewrote the entire project using a fork on the discord.py library, discord rewrite - here&amp;rsquo;s the up to date repo. The project as a whole was a great intrudction to python, my favourite part of the whole project would have to be the hearthstone deckstring decoder.</description>

      <description>Age of Empires 2 Counter List There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a centralized source for counters in AoE2, so I decided to make one. It pulls from various sources, ranging from the wiki, Spirit of the Law, various AoK threads, and Steam discussions. For the icons, I went through and downloaded each image from the wiki, photoshoped out the black background, and uploaded it to imgur. Looking back, I wish I knew python so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do it manually.</description>
