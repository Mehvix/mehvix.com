      <description>First of all, what is dropshipping? Simply put, dropshipping is where you find a product on one site and list it on another site for a higher price than the original site so that you collect the margins. The beauty is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to ever come in contact with the produce - when someone orders the item on the site you&amp;rsquo;re listing it on, all you have to do is buy the prodcut on the original site with your customers shipping information.</description>

      <description>The problem My settings and configs had no way to sync between my desktop and laptop, e.g. all my custom keybinds would be on one computer but not the other.
The solution Using python 3 I wrote a script that can copy and install config files to and from a given directory (I used my nextcloud server). The source code is on my Github, but I would highly recommend that you&amp;rsquo;re careful and use a test directory if you want to modify the code - I acciedently deleted my config files more then once while testing.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2018 and taught my self python 3 and built my first Discord bot for my server. A couple months later, I rewrote the entire project using a fork on the discord.py library, discord rewrite - here&amp;rsquo;s the up to date repo. The project as a whole was a great intrudction to python, my favourite part of the whole project would have to be the hearthstone deckstring decoder.</description>

      <description>Age of Empires 2 Counter List There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a centralized source for counters in AoE2, so I decided to make one. It pulls from various sources, ranging from the wiki, Spirit of the Law, various AoK threads, and Steam discussions. For the icons, I went through and downloaded each image from the wiki, photoshoped out the black background, and uploaded it to imgur. Looking back, I wish I knew python so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do it manually.</description>
