<h4 id="how-i-was-the-1-result-on-ebay-and-then-got-all-of-my-money-frozen">How I was the #1 result on eBay and then got all of my money frozen</h4>

<p>---</p>

<h3 id="first-of-all-what-is-dropshipping">First of all, what is dropshipping?</h3>

<p>Simply put, dropshipping is where you find a product on one site and list it on another site for a higher price than the original site so that you collect the margins. The beauty is that you don&rsquo;t have to ever come in contact with the produce - when someone orders the item on the site you&rsquo;re listing it on, all you have to do is buy the prodcut on the original site with  your customers shipping information.</p>

<p>Dropshipping is relatively easy to do <em>after</em> you get the ball rolling. It&rsquo;s the process of finding a niche and getting enough inital tracktion on whatever secondary site you&rsquo;re reselling on that&rsquo;s the hard part</p>

<h4 id="part-1-finding-a-niche">Part 1:     Finding a Niche</h4>

<p>From the guides that I read about, most finacial &ldquo;experts&rdquo; recommended to find a niche that you can market to a market that you are passtionate about for two main reasons:</p>

<p>1.) It&rsquo;s easier to find a product that you know people (from whatever niche) want <br>
 2.) It&rsquo;s easier to know where to advertise</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t do that. While I think that this method has merit to it, the stuff I was passionate about at the time was fencing, snowboarding, and computers - not the easiest market to break into; Most people are already price checking every item to get the best value.</p>

<p>Instead, I choose to go for what other kids in my grade where into: Supreme.</p>

<h4 id="part-2-finding-the-item-s-to-resell">Part 2:    Finding the item(s) to Resell</h4>

<p>The advice that best helped me out throughout this entire scheme was to check out <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. Etsy has some pretty cool stuff that isn&rsquo;t on main stream sites like Amazon or eBay. After browsing the site for the term &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo;, I found a fake bogo tee that had good reviews and nice photos for $12.99 (I gotta check these numbers some time, but something in that range) //TODO check this. Comparing that price to similar items on eBay, it was a steal - similar items were going for upwards of $20.00. That meant that I could be making ~$7.00 profit for each purchase.</p>

<h4 id="part-3-listing-the-item">Part 3:    Listing the Item</h4>

<p>The website I chose to go with was eBay. It&rsquo;s easier than Amazon to start off and, from what I had read, was easier to be manipulated by SEO (Search Engine Optimization). I listed the item with an agressive price of $15.00, sat back, and waited. This was my first time drop shipping, so I wasn&rsquo;t confident that ads where necissary and I didn&rsquo;t have the bankroll to purchase ads even if I wanted to.</p>

<h1 id="todo-check-the-price-listing-settings-and-take-screenshots">//TODO check the price/listing settings and take screenshots</h1>

<h4 id="part-4-fufilling-the-orders">Part 4:    Fufilling the Orders</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it my SEO or just luck, but I started getting orders a 1 day after creating the listing. eBay&rsquo;s product rating is a recusion, the more more people buy the item, the more it shows it to more people, causing more people to buy it. Because I was on the front page when you searched &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo;, I bumped up the price each from $15 to $2.50 lower than the next highest price, putting me at $18.50. At school, every study hall I was in the computer lab on either eBay or Etsy placing orders. A week after listing my shirt I had made $1,000+ in sales and was the #1 result when you searched &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo;</p>
