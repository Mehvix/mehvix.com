### The problem

My settings and configs had no way to sync between my desktop and laptop, e.g. all my custom keybinds would be on one computer but not the other.


### The solution

Using python 3 I wrote a script that can copy and install config files to and from a given directory (I used my nextcloud server). The source code is on my [Github](https://github.com/Mehvix/ApplicationConfigs), but I would *highly* recommend that you're careful and use a test directory if you want to modify the code - I acciedently deleted my config files more then once while testing.
