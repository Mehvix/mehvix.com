## [SynapsBot](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBotRW)
In the summer of 2018 and taught my self python 3 and built my [first Discord bot](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBot/) for my server. A couple months later, I rewrote the entire project using a fork on the discord.py library, discord rewrite, and still use the bot to this day<br><br>


## [Application Configs](https://github.com/Mehvix/ApplicationConfigs)
Using Python 3 I wrote a script that backs-up and installs config files for various applications so that I could have the same settings across machines. This project taught me the importance of using test environment when modifying data.<br><br>


## Google Sheet Projects
### [Age of Empires 2 Counter List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XMFVhx-bJQJ3PbZEbJ4C4Bpw1CY5dKFiE6sr9MWpJME/edit#gid=0)<br>
I created a spreadsheet containing a list of all the counters to units in Age of Empires 2. It pulls from various sources, including the [AoE wiki](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:Portal), [Spirit of the Law](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzLZJo-SxuPHz-oYKAIC_g), various AoK threads, and Steam discussions. Since it's release, it's accumulated over 9,000 unique views on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=773136659).


### Overwatch LFT 
>When I used to play Overwatch I made a spreadsheet/Google Form system for players that didn't want to solo-que. During the 3 seasons which I ran it, it collected over 4,000 responses and helped me find players to form a scrim team. The sheets for the various seasons can be found here:

- [Season 3](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5wbh_M5dB_8TWN6VHVfdFZBZVE)<br>
- [Season 4](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5wbh_M5dB_8dkJLMHdCZW9nUTQ)<br>
- [Season 5](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5wbh_M5dB_8YTlXT3RtRUg3czQ)


### Overwatch Pro Settings
In addition to the LFT list, I created a compilation of the gear and settings of 250+ Overwatch professionals. Now it's outdated, but still serves as a reference - here's the URL
