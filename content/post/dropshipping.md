#### How I was the #1 result on eBay and then got all of my money frozen

\-\-\-

### First of all, what is dropshipping? 

Simply put, dropshipping is where you find a product on one site and list it on another site for a higher price than the original site so that you collect the margins. The beauty is that you don't have to ever come in contact with the produce - when someone orders the item on the site you're listing it on, all you have to do is buy the prodcut on the original site with  your customers shipping information. 


Dropshipping is relatively easy to do *after* you get the ball rolling. It's the process of finding a niche and getting enough inital tracktion on whatever secondary site you're reselling on that's the hard part



#### Part 1:     Finding a Niche
From the guides that I read about, most finacial "experts" recommended to find a niche that you can market to a market that you are passtionate about for two main reasons:

 1.) It's easier to find a product that you know people (from whatever niche) want <br>
 2.) It's easier to know where to advertise
 
I didn't do that. While I think that this method has merit to it, the stuff I was passionate about at the time was fencing, snowboarding, and computers - not the easiest market to break into; Most people are already price checking every item to get the best value. 
 
Instead, I choose to go for what other kids in my grade where into: Supreme.


#### Part 2:    Finding the item(s) to Resell
The advice that best helped me out throughout this entire scheme was to check out [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com). Etsy has some pretty cool stuff that isn't on main stream sites like Amazon or eBay. After browsing the site for the term "Supreme", I found a fake bogo tee that had good reviews and nice photos for $12.99 (I gotta check these numbers some time, but something in that range) //TODO check this. Comparing that price to similar items on eBay, it was a steal - similar items were going for upwards of $20.00. That meant that I could be making ~$7.00 profit for each purchase.


#### Part 3:    Listing the Item
The website I chose to go with was eBay. It's easier than Amazon to start off and, from what I had read, was easier to be manipulated by SEO (Search Engine Optimization). I listed the item with an agressive price of $15.00, sat back, and waited. This was my first time drop shipping, so I wasn't confident that ads where necissary and I didn't have the bankroll to purchase ads even if I wanted to.

#### Part 4:    Fufilling the Orders
I don't know if it my SEO or just luck, but I started getting orders a 1 day after creating the listing. eBay's product rating is a recusion, the more more people buy the item, the more it shows it to more people, causing more people to buy it. Because I was on the front page when you searched "Supreme", I bumped up the price each from $15 to $2.50 lower than the next highest price, putting me at $18.50. At school, every study hall I was in the computer lab on either eBay or Etsy placing orders. A week after listing my shirt I had made $1,000+ in sales and was the #1 result when you searched "Supreme"

#### Part 5:    The sky comes falling down
