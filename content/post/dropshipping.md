### First of all, what is dropshipping? 

Simply put, dropshipping is where you find a product on one site and list it on another site for a higher price than the original site so that you collect the margins. The beauty is that you don't have to ever come in contact with the produce - when someone orders the item on the site you're listing it on, all you have to do is buy the prodcut on the original site with  your customers shipping information. 


Dropshipping is relatively easy to do *after* you get the ball rolling. It's the process of finding a niche and getting enough inital tracktion on whatever secondary site you're reselling on that's the hard part



#### Part 1:     Finding a Niche
From the guides that I read about, most finacial "experts" recommended to find a niche that you can market to a market that you are passtionate about for two main reasons:

<span>&ensp;</span>   1.) It's easier to find a product that you know people (from whatever niche) want <br>
<span>&ensp;</span>   2.) It's easier to know where to advertise
 
I didn't do that. While I think that this method has merit to it, the stuff I was passionate about at the time was fencing, snowboarding, and computers - not the easiest market to break into; Most people are already price checking every item to get the best value. 
 
Instead, I choose to go for what other kids in my grade where into: Supreme.


#### Part 2:    Finding the item(s) to Resell
The advice that best helped me out throughout this entire scheme was to check out [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com). Etsy has some pretty cool stuff that isn't on main stream sites like Amazon or eBay. After browsing the site for the term "Supreme", I found a fake bogo tee that had good reviews and nice photos (that I could use for my listing) for just $12.79, including shipping. 

#### Part 3:    Listing the Item
The website I chose to go with was eBay. It's easier than Amazon to start off and, from what I had read, was easier to be manipulated by SEO. Similar listings on eBay where going for around $25.00, so I decided to undercut them and go with $17.50.


#### Part 4:    Fufilling the Orders
I don't know if it my SEO or just luck, but I started getting orders a 1 day after creating the listing. eBay's product rating is a recusion, the more more people buy the item, the more it shows it to more people, causing more people to buy it, etc. Because my listing was on the front page for the search "Supreme", I bumped up the price to $21.89. At this point I had a couple orders each day. Because I didn't know how to write a bot to place orders, every study hall at school I was in the computer lab placing orders. A week after listing my shirt I had made $1,000+ in sales, and was sitting with a net gain of ~$350 in my PayPal.

#### Part 5:    The sky comes falling down
What I didn't know was that after 50 sales on eBay, PayPal wants to know you're older than 18. At this point I didn't know what to do; I didn't know how to Photoshop ID and I already had my bank linked to the PayPal account, so using someone else's ID was out of the question. I ended up getting my PayPal locked for 9 months, but on the bright side eBay couldn't withdraw the funds for their seller fee, so I ended up not having to pay for it :).


#### Part 6:    Lessons Learned
PayPal sucks
