Here's a list of projects that I haven't gotten around to doing

### - A program to automatically download videos from a YouTube playlist
> Prevent [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jon_Bois/comments/ab6930/does_anyone_happen_to_have_pretty_good_episode_4/) from happening again. I'm thinking of using [webhooks](https://zapier.com) and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

### - Visualize [Typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) data
> I did something [similar already](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBotRW/blob/master/typeracer.py) to this on my [discord bot](https://mehvix.com/posts/synapsbot/) already, but I used typeracer's limited statistics .json for the user. You can export your data to a .cvs if you have a premium account, but I don't. However, I think you should be able to scrap [this webpage](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/race_history?user=mehvix&n=9999&startDate=) and save it as a cvs. Then it's a matter of visualizing the data, which I've never done before.

### - Create a [Startpage](https://old.reddit.com/r/startpages)

### - Selfhost a [SearX](https://searx.me/about) instance

### - Script that disables the windows key when a game is launched

### - Design / 3D print a custom mouse using G305 internals

### - Make either a physical or digital pomodo timer

### - Selfhost a home security server
> This can probably be done with a bunch of raspberry pi zeros and a an equal number of PS2 webcams

### - CAD a neo-swerve drive

### - AI for Age of Empires 2

### - Remote car starter for the winter

### - Make a "finals" grade calculator for school

### - Create a discord rich-embed for Voobly
> - [Voobly's API docs](https://www.voobly.com/pages/view/147/External-API-Documentation#lobbiesgameid)
> - This may be irrelevant when DE comes out

### - Light alarm clock
> You can buy a alarm clock that gradually gets brighter to simulate the sun rising, but they're $100+. 
> This could probably be done with an arduino, but I don't know how I'd limit the brightness of a light.

### - Visual poker-tracker for Pokerstars
> A program that can track how your opponents play at the table in Pokerstars

### - A year-round "Spoty Wrapped"
> Something like [this](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-12-06/relive-your-year-in-music-with-spotify-wrapped-2018/), but not for just once a year

### - CAD --> Print --> Wire a custom drone

### - Write a program to find the sizing of a key, then generate a CAD file that's to scale
