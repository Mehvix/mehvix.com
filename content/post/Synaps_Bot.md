In the summer of 2018 and taught my self python 3 and built my [first Discord bot](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBot/) for my server. A couple months later, I rewrote the entire project using a fork on the discord.py library, discord rewrite - here's the [up to date repo](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBotRW). The project as a whole was a great intrudction to python, my favourite part of the whole project would have to be the [hearthstone deckstring decoder](https://github.com/Mehvix/synapsBotRW/blob/master/hearthstone_decode.py).
