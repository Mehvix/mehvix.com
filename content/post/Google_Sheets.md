### Age of Empires 2 Counter List
There wasn't a centralized source for counters in AoE2, so I decided to make one. It pulls from various sources, ranging from the [wiki](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:Portal), [Spirit of the Law](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzLZJo-SxuPHz-oYKAIC_g), various AoK threads, and Steam discussions. For the icons, I went through and downloaded each image from the wiki, photoshoped out the black background, and uploaded it to imgur. Looking back, I wish I knew python so I didn't have to do it manually. Since it's release, it's accumulated over 9,000 unique views on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=773136659).

### Overwatch LFT 
Pissed off due to queing with bad teammates in Overwatch, I create a hub for likeminded players using Google Forms and Sheets so that you didn't have to go through various forums and discords to find good teammates. During the 3 seasons, it collected over 4,000 responses and I climbed from 2,500 elo to 4,000. While the forms aren't accepting responses, they as well as the Google Sheets can be found here:

### Overwatch Pro Settings
In addition to the LFT list, I created a compilation of the gear and settings of 250+ Overwatch professionals. Now it's outdated, but still serves as a reference - here's the URL
