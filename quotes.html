                For example, John Mallinckrodt (CSU Pomona) relates the story of a student asking Richard Feynman if
                there is any intuitive way to understand the result; Feynman went into deep thought for about 10 or 15
                seconds and answered, "no."

                "And I have no illusions that I’ll be remembered for very long. If Byron White is as nearly forgotten as
                he is now, as he said he would be, I have no illusions, I won’t last five minutes; that’s as it should
                be. <br><br>

                The great joy in life, Shaw said, is devoting yourself to a cause you deem mighty before you are thrown
                on the scrap heap. An independent judiciary in this country, I can carry that baton for as long as I can
                carry it, and I have no illusions I’m going to last as long as you suggest, and that’ll be good enough
                for me."

            <b>Evil</b>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0">
                “It was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its
                load, this essential experience; how a human being becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of
                youthful successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the surfeit of
                power I was a murderer, and an oppressor. In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was doing good,
                and I was well supplied with systematic arguments. And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison
                straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the
                line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political
                parties either—but right through every human heart—and through all human hearts. This line shifts.
                Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small
                bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains… an unuprooted small
                corner of evil.”

            <b>A Libertarian Puzzle</b>
            <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0">
                Allow me to oversimplify.<br><br>
                People disagree about ends: Some people want to promote broader human flourishing, others want to
                preserve the status quo. People disagree about means: Some people think unfettered markets will best
                promote broader human flourishing, others think unfettered markets will best preserve the status
                quo.<br><br>
                We have a nice two-by-two: people who want to promote human flourishing and think that unfettered
                markets are the best way to get there (libertarians), people who want to promote human flourishing and
                think that unfettered markets are an impediment (socialists), people who want to preserve the status quo
                and think unfettered markets are the best way to get there (capitalists), people who want to preserve
                the status quo and think unfettered markets are an impediment (statists).<br><br>
                Both libertarians and capitalists will go around saying that unfettered markets are great. And both of
                them will try to persuade their audience by telling their audience that unfettered markets will lead to
                the thing their audience wants. If the audience wants to preserve the status quo, they will emphasize
                how unfettered markets properly reward the dynamic innovators who create greatness in the world. If the
                audience wants to promote human flourishing, they will emphasize how unfettered markets give everyone
                the opportunity to succeed without the inhibiting force of government regulation.<br><br>
                The trouble is, as an audience member, you can’t really tell whether the speaker is actually a
                capitalist or a libertarian (or a libertarian who has been duped by a capitalist, or a capitalist who
                has been duped by a libertarian). Like any salesman, they’ll tell you that their product is the perfect
                thing to accomplish your needs.<br><br>
                Which leaves just one puzzle: why are there so few statists?
